## Overview

This repository contains top 10 hacking Operating System for setting up a penetration testing home lab. The lab is designed for security enthusiasts and professionals to practice and enhance their skills in a controlled environment.


# Description.
Hacking Operating System refers to the specialized operating system designed for penetration testing, ethical hacking, and network security assessments. And Kali Linux is a popular operating system widely used by ethical hackers and penetration testers. It is a Debian-based Linux distribution that comes pre-installed with numerous security tools for various tasks such as information gathering, network analysis, penetration testing, vulnerability assessment and forensic analysis. Examples of pre-installed include Metasploit, Wireshark, Nmap, and Burp Suite.

## Requirements

### Hardware
- Powerful computer with sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, Storage)
- Network Interface Cards (NICs)
- Ample storage, preferably SSD

### Virtualization Software
- Hypervisor: VMware, VirtualBox, or KVM

### Operating Systems
- Kali Linux, parrostSec, etc (penetration testing distribution)
- Metasploitable, web for pentester, etc (vulnerable VM)
- Windows Server/Desktop (for real-world scenarios)

### Networking
- Router for network segmentation
- Managed switch for VLANs
- Firewall for traffic control

### Wireless Network
- Wireless router/access point for testing wireless security

### Lab Topology Design
- Segmentation into different network segments (DMZ, internal network, etc.)
- Isolation from the production network

### Security Tools
- Vulnerability Scanner: OpenVAS, Nessus
- Exploitation Frameworks: Metasploit, others
- Packet Sniffers: Wireshark
- IDS/IPS for monitoring

### Logging and Monitoring
- Syslog server for log collection
- SIEM solution for log analysis
